## Biography

I am a first-year PhD student in Education Data Science and EDGE fellow at Stanford University. My research focus lies at the intersection of natural language processing, sociology, and higher education. I am interested in how computational social sciences can help us better understand social stratification in the transition to higher education. My advisors are [Dan McFarland](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/mcfarland) and [Mitchell Stevens](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/stevens4). Prior to my doctoral studies, I was a predoctoral researcher at the [Annenberg Institute](https://annenberg.brown.edu) at Brown University and at the [Laboratory for Interdisciplinary Evaluation of Public Policies](https://www.sciencespo.fr/liepp/en.html) at Sciences Po.
