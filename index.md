## About

I am a first-year doctoral student in Education Data Science and EDGE fellow at Stanford University. My research focus lies at the intersection of natural language processing, sociology, and higher education. My advisors are [Dan McFarland](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/mcfarland) and [Mitchell Stevens](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/stevens4). Previously, I was a predoctoral researcher at the [Annenberg Institute](https://annenberg.brown.edu) at Brown University and at the [Laboratory for Interdisciplinary Evaluation of Public Policies](https://www.sciencespo.fr/liepp/en.html) at Sciences Po.
