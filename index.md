## About

I am a first-year doctoral student in Education Data Science and EDGE fellow at the Stanford Graduate School of Education. My research focus lies at the intersection of data science, sociology, and higher education. My advisors are [Dan McFarland](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/mcfarland) and [Mitchell Stevens](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/stevens4). Previously, I was a predoctoral researcher at the [Annenberg Institute for School Reform](https://annenberg.brown.edu) at Brown University and at the [Laboratory for Interdisciplinary Evaluation of Public Policies](https://www.sciencespo.fr/liepp/en.html) at Sciences Po. My work has been presented at the annual meetings of the American Educational Research Association, the Association for the Study of Higher Education, the European Sociological Association, the European Educational Research Association, the British Educational Research Association, and the French Sociological Association.
